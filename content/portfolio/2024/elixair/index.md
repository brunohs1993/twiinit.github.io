### Objectives

- Provide standardized and templated spreadsheets interfaced with our simulation tool.
- A digital twin of a climatic sink based on standard models to compute energy savings during a year.

### The spreadsheet

- From few inputs, the user instantly gets the results of the simulation embedded in their spreadsheet (outlet temperature, energy savings and head losses).
- They know that it respects the standard they have to follow and is able to export all the results directly within a templated report.
- Extended language support in French, English, German and Spanish in just one click.

### Outlook
- A fully customised tool that you can easily control.
- Everything you need is gathered on the same page and available just a click away.
- The digital twin engine is tested and robust. It is even extensible if you need to connect new tool to it!
